In HTML

1. Created a container box to hold the drawing tool.
2. Added a heading called Canvas Drawing Tool.
3. Used the <canvas> tag to create a drawing area of fixed width and height.
4. Connected the canvas with JavaScript for drawing features.

In CSS

1. Styled the container with border, margin, and padding.
2. Set a fixed width (650px) and background color (white) for the container.
3. Styled the canvas with a light background and a dark border.
4. Changed the cursor to crosshair inside the canvas to indicate drawing mode.
5. Made the layout simple and clean so focus stays on the drawing feature.


In JavaScript

1. Selected the canvas using getElementById and got its 2d drawing context.
2. Defined variables to track mouse position and whether the user is drawing.
3. Added an event for mousedown to start drawing.
4. Added an event for mousemove to draw lines when the mouse is pressed.
5. Added an event for mouseup to stop drawing.
6. Used mouseenter and mouseleave to track if the mouse is inside the canvas area.
7. Used line styles (strokeStyle, lineWidth, lineCap) to make smooth blue lines.
